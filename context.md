General

Soliloan is an app that allows projects that are funded via direct loans from private people (crowdinvesting) to manage their loans including:

- create new lenders with contact and banking information
- create new loans for that lenders, update the loans and delete them
- create notes or upload files to lenders or loans
- create transactions for the loans like deposits and withdrawals

The app is multi tenant, so it allows to create, update and delete projects with and administrator account, while a manager account is restricted to only manage the lenders and loans of the projects he has access to. 

The lenders themselves also have a user account, where they can view the loans that they gave to different projects. This is a separate view to the manager / admin view. 

For managers there should be a dashboard showing and overview over all projects. There should be a project selector to go into the project workspace where the manager can then manage the project data (lenders, loans, transactions, notes, uploads)
